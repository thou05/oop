A reference provides an *alias*—a different name—for a variable

It allows a function to modify a variable without having to create a copy of it. We have to declare reference variables. The memory location of the passed variable and parameter is the same and therefore, any change to the parameter reflects in the variable as well.

A reference is the same object, just with a different name and a reference must refer to an object. Since references can’t be NULL, they are safer to use.
